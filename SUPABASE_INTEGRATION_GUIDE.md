# 🚀 Complete Supabase Integration for Taiyaki Dog Charm Quiz

This guide explains the **complete Supabase-only integration** that tracks ALL parts of the quiz and design process, including file storage.

## 📋 What's Been Integrated

### ✅ Complete Supabase-Only System
- **Quiz Sessions**: Every user journey from start to finish
- **Individual Responses**: Each quiz answer tracked separately  
- **User Analytics**: Button clicks, form inputs, page interactions
- **Design Iterations**: AI generation attempts and results
- **Error Tracking**: Failed attempts with detailed error messages
- **Performance Metrics**: Generation times, completion rates
- **File Storage**: All photos and generated designs stored in Supabase Storage

### ✅ Database Schema + Storage
- `quiz_sessions` - Main table tracking complete user journeys
- `quiz_responses` - Individual quiz answers breakdown
- `user_analytics` - User behavior and interaction events
- `design_iterations` - AI design generation tracking
- `taiyaki-uploads` - Storage bucket for all files (photos + renders)
- Pre-built analytics views for insights

### ✅ API Endpoints
- `/api/supabase-complete-flow` - Main flow with full Supabase tracking + storage
- `/api/track-analytics` - Real-time user interaction tracking

### ✅ Client-Side Analytics
- Automatic tracking of all user interactions
- Real-time event batching and sending
- Error handling and retry logic

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup (Already Done)
Your Supabase project is configured with:
- **URL**: `https://hsigcnuiekahlgnzxxqh.supabase.co`
- **Anon Key**: Already in `env.local`
- **Schema**: Run `supabase-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor

### 2. Install Dependencies (Already Done)
```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```
*Note: Firebase has been removed - everything now uses Supabase!*

### 3. Apply Database Schema + Storage Setup
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
4. Paste and run the SQL (this creates tables AND storage bucket)

### 4. Test the Integration
1. Open `test-supabase-integration.html` in your browser
2. Run all the tests to verify everything works
3. Check your Supabase dashboard for data AND files

## 🔄 How to Use

### Option 1: Replace Current Flow (Recommended)
Update your main quiz to use the new Supabase-only endpoint:

```javascript
// In your quiz submission function, change:
const response = await fetch('/api/process-complete-flow', {
    // ... existing code
});

// To:
const response = await fetch('/api/supabase-complete-flow', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        formData: formData,
        imageGenerationPrompts: {
            designPrompt: prompt
        }
    })
});
```

### Option 2: Add Analytics to Existing Flow
Include the analytics script in your main `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Add before closing </body> tag -->
<script src="supabase-analytics.js"></script>
```

This will automatically track:
- Page loads and navigation
- Button clicks and option selections
- Form input changes
- File uploads
- Quiz completion events

    dog_name,
    status,
    photo_url,
    render_url,
    created_at,
    completed_at
FROM quiz_sessions 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### File Storage Analytics
```sql
-- Check storage usage
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_files,
    SUM(CASE WHEN photo_url IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as photos_uploaded,
    SUM(CASE WHEN render_url IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as designs_generated
FROM quiz_sessions;
```

### Performance Metrics
```sql
-- Average generation times
SELECT 
    AVG(generation_time_ms) as avg_generation_time,
    COUNT(*) as total_generations
FROM design_iterations;
```

### Popular Quiz Responses
```sql
SELECT * FROM popular_quiz_responses;
```

### User Journey Funnel
